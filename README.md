# Retro Recall
Retro Recall is a memory matching card game that started out as an assignment from the [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com) curriculum on using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After implementing the basic game functionality I went deeper, adding enhancements to the game interface (the flipping cards) and styling the game to give it a retro 80s look and feel inspired by the game Space Invaders.

## Acknowledgements

- The CSS code for flipping the game cards draws heavily on information from [How To - Flip Card](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp).

- The card images and color scheme were inspired by [this space invaders wall art](https://popcanvas.co/space-invaders-set/).
